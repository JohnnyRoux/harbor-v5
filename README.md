# Harbor - Final Clean Version

This version has:
- A root layout AND per-folder `layout.tsx` files (import, results, pricing, company).
- Simplified pages (Home, Import, Results, Pricing, Company).
- CSV importer that saves to localStorage.

## Deploy
1. Upload this folder's contents to a new GitHub repo.
2. In Vercel, import that repo as a Next.js project.
3. Deploy should succeed with no missing layout errors.

Then go to `/import` to upload CSV â†’ `/results` to view.
